- Prometheus Server: We can monitor metrics data and set up alerting rule for that.
- AlertManager: It can be notified users when alerts are happened.
- Grafana: We can monitor graphics that Prometheus is getting metrics, and it can be notified users when alerts are happened in Grafana also.
- Elasticsearch:
- Kibana:
- Logstash:
- Jeager: It's easy for us to understand how networking that we created is connecting with other component. (Under deployment)
